 inotail - inotify enhanced tail
o===============================o

inotail is a drop-in replacement for the 'tail' program found in the base
installation of every Linux/UNIX system. It makes use of the inotify
infrastructure in recent versions of the Linux kernel to speed up tailing files
in the follow mode (the '-f' option). Currently inotail is not fully compatible
to neither POSIX or GNU tail but might be in the future.

Requirements
------------
- Linux kernel 2.6.13 or higher with CONFIG_INOTIFY enabled
- Future versions will require a version of the glibc shipping with inotify
  support

License
-------
inotail is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License Version 2.
